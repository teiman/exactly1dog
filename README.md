Quake Modificacion
------------------

Based on Ironwail. All bugs are mine. All cool stuff is from ironwail.

Plan:

A "corruption level" is show on the screen while playing normal Quake or any mod. 
This curruption level may increase when you do something that satisfy the chaos gods.
If the corruption level is high, the chaos gods will interfere directly. May give you weapons, ammo, or enemies that will attack you.
The corruption level has persistence, even if you shutdown the game, the corruption continue.
